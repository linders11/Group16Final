This project is a combination of assembly language and C programs to be able to print debug data of
registers with a simple function call while inside a running program. The first program, dump_registers.s,
will dump the name, value, and value (in hexadecimal format) of the registers: rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, 
rdi, rbp, rsp, r8â€“r15. The second program, dump_backtrace.s, will walk back through the stack and print the 
call history until it reaches the beginning (%rbp = NULL), or until the stack frame reaches 64 which is a 
pretty reasonable amount for most programs.

Thank you for a great term and have a great summer, whether it be the professor or the TA reading this.
